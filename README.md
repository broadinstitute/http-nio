# Origins
This project was originally developed by [Daniel Gómez-Sánchez](https://github.com/magicDGS) as [magicDGS/jsr203-http](https://github.com/magicDGS/jsr203-http).
This fork renames the project to be more easily understandable.  It also changes the package names so that it can be published under our maven central group.
